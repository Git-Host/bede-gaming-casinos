# Bede Gaming Developer Test
As a way for Bede Gaming to get to know a developers skills, they ask you to do a simple task with some deliverables, please see [bref.md](bref.md)

## Setup
To setup this project, please run the following commands in a terminal;

```bash
composer install
npm install
gulp
php artisan serve
```
  
This will install all composer dependencies, then the node dependencies, run `gulp` to process any CSS and JS files, and finally start the local PHP Server using Laravel.

## Tests
At this moment there aren't any, I wish to learn TDD etc. but haven't had a chance to use it in a work environment, and at home I tend to hack more than produce production read code 1st time.
